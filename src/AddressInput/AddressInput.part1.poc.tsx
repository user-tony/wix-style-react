/**
 * This document is a summary of the thinking process i went through when i was faced with a task to create the
 * next version of WSR AddressInput component, an input component the can provide autocomplete suggestions for geo-location
 * addresses.
 */

/**
 * So let's start with what we had already defined, which is the visual specs of the new component (Zeplin).
 * Usually, this is not enough, in most of the times you will get to see there how the desired component should look like,
 * sometimes you will even get some "hints" for behaviour definitions and future capabilities.
 * But to be able to build a full product out of it we will need a better product definitions.
 * In our use case, since we had no product capacity at the time, we had to start with just that.
 *
 * At this point, you must be super careful when you are trying to convert your visual spec into a technical spec
 * by avoiding including into it any business logic and decision making. The way i like to think of it is like i am
 * building a marionette, i need it to be able to perform the "movements" required but i am not it's puppeteer.

/**
 * <AddressInput/>
 * This is our "marionette" component, it's responsibility is to follow the product visual definitions and behaviour
 * guidelines, this way any consumer that wishes to build it's own address lookup solution will be able to reuse it and
 * only take care of his specific use cases.
 *
 * In the following suggested api, we can see our props divided into 3 different groups, we will see later how this
 * can provide us clarity when composing with this component... */

 * location service provider, Google Places is a good use case since it is what we currently use in our old component
 * and probably we will need to support it in the new one as well. Let see how such a provider can look like... */

 * <GooglePlacesServiceProvider/>
 * Google Places is a service that provides autocomplete suggestions for a given user input, we want to encapsulate this

 *
 * Note: This api is inspired by a 3rd-party hook named `use-places-autocomplete` (just in a render-props fashion).
 * I am not suggesting that all location providers should comply with this api, we will need to be able to support
 * different api signatures and we will address it later.

 * UI-Layer API and vise-versa.
 *
 * GooglePlacesService  -/->  AddressInput (service-api !== component-props)
 *
 * Therefore, we will need an adapter to make the two talk to each other.
 * Clarification, when speaking about adapters i will refer to function components that receive one type of api signature
 * and return an different type of api-signature by applying transformations to the received props.
 * These adapters should be pure, hence, shouldn't hold any state or perform side-effects.

 * Now, i can see why the code above can be eye pleasing to some while mind bending to others, it is just for

 * In the next part we will see what type of products we can build with it and which additional building blocks we will
